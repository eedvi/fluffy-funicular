## Executive Summary

After a comprehensive review of the pawn shop management system, I've identified a robust foundation with significant business logic already implemented. The system has **advanced features like automated credit scoring, overdue interest charging, and customer notifications** - but several of these powerful features lack user interfaces or are underutilized.

---

## Current Architecture

### Core Models (11)
1. **Customer** - With credit scoring, income tracking, emergency contacts
2. **Loan** - Core business model with overdue interest rate support
3. **LoanRenewal** - Recently completed renewal system
4. **InterestCharge** - Automated interest tracking (‚ö†Ô∏è NO UI)
5. **Payment** - Payment tracking system
6. **Sale** - Sales management
7. **Item** - Inventory/collateral management
8. **Branch** - Multi-location support
9. **User** - Staff with role-based permissions
10. **FailedLoginAttempt** - Security tracking
11. **Session** - Active session monitoring

### Existing Business Logic

#### 1. **Credit Scoring System** ‚≠ê (ADVANCED, UNDERUTILIZED)
**Location:** `app/Services/CreditScoreService.php`

**Current Implementation:**
- **Score Range:** 300-850 (FICO-like)
- **5 Scoring Factors:**
  - Payment History (35% weight)
  - Loan Performance (30% weight)
  - Credit Utilization (20% weight)
  - Account Age (10% weight)
  - Recent Activity (5% weight)

**Ratings:**
- Excellent: 750+
- Good: 650-749
- Fair: 550-649
- Poor: <550

**Features:**
- Automatic credit limit recommendations
- Penalty system for late payments (-15 pts each)
- Severe penalty for defaults (-100 pts each)
- Rewards for on-time payments (+150 pts max)

**‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS:**
- ‚ùå No Filament UI to view customer scores
- ‚ùå Credit limits are recommended but not enforced
- ‚ùå No automatic updates (must run command manually)
- ‚ùå Not integrated into loan approval process
- ‚ùå Staff cannot see score history/trends

---

#### 2. **Automated Interest Charges** ‚≠ê (ADVANCED, NO UI)
**Location:** `app/Console/Commands/CalculateOverdueInterest.php`

**Current Implementation:**
- **Daily automatic interest** on overdue loans
- **Dual interest rates:** Normal + Overdue rate
- **Formula:** `(balance √ó rate% / 100) / 30` per day
- **Tracking:** Every charge logged in `interest_charges` table
- **Notifications:** Sends to admins + customer email
- **Smart Prevention:** Won't charge twice in one day

**Interest Charge Fields:**
- charge_date, days_overdue
- interest_rate, principal_amount, interest_amount
- balance_before, balance_after
- charge_type, notes, is_applied

**‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS:**
- ‚ùå **No Filament Resource for InterestCharge model**
- ‚ùå Cannot view/manage interest charges in UI
- ‚ùå No reports on interest revenue
- ‚ùå Cannot waive/reverse interest charges
- ‚ùå No customer portal to see interest breakdown

---

#### 3. **Automated Notifications**
**Commands:**
- `SendLoanReminders` - 3-day advance reminder
- `CalculateOverdueInterest` - Overdue notifications

**‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS:**
- ‚ùå Only email notifications (no SMS)
- ‚ùå Fixed 3-day reminder (not configurable)
- ‚ùå No reminder for renewals approaching
- ‚ùå No bulk notification UI
- ‚ùå Cannot customize templates from UI

---

#### 4. **Multi-Branch System** ‚úÖ (WELL IMPLEMENTED)
- Branch scoping on models
- Permission-based access (Cajero sees only their branch)
- Branch filtering in reports

---
