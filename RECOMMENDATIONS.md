# System Improvement Recommendations

## ðŸŽ¯ High Priority (Security & Critical Features)

### 1. **Customer Management Enhancements**
**Current State**: Cajero can only view customers, cannot create them
**Issue**: When creating a loan/sale, cashier needs to add new customers
**Recommendation**:
-  Grant `create_customer` permission to Cajero
- Add customer creation directly from Loan/Sale forms (modal or inline)
- Keep update/delete restricted to Admin/Gerente

### 2. **Item Management for Cashiers**
**Current State**: Cajero cannot create items
**Issue**: When accepting collateral, cashier needs to register new items
**Recommendation**:
-  Grant `create_item` permission to Cajero
- Consider workflow: Customer brings item â†’ Cashier registers it â†’ Creates loan
- Keep update/delete restricted (items shouldn't change after loan creation)

### 3. **Edit Permissions for Active Operations**
**Current State**: Cajero cannot edit ANY records
**Issue**: Need to correct mistakes in loans/payments/sales they just created
**Recommendation**:
-  Grant `update_loan`, `update_payment`, `update_sale` to Cajero
- Add business rule: Can only edit records from current day
- Add business rule: Cannot edit if payment has been made (for loans)
- Consider adding "reason for edit" field with activity logging

### 4. **Loan Status Management**
**Current State**: Loan status changes are manual
**Recommendation**:
-  Implement automatic status updates:
  - `active` â†’ `overdue` when due_date < today
  - `active` â†’ `paid` when balance_remaining = 0
  - Add scheduled task: `php artisan schedule:work`
- Add "Mark as Defaulted" action for Gerente/Admin only
- Add "Extend Due Date" action for Cajero (with approval workflow)

### 5. **Payment Validation**
**Current State**: No validation preventing overpayment
**Recommendation**:
-  Add validation: payment amount â‰¤ loan balance_remaining
- Add warning when payment = exact balance (loan will be marked paid)
- Auto-calculate balance after payment

## ðŸ”’ Security Enhancements

### 6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
**Recommendation**:

- Use `filament/filament-2fa` or similar package
- Optional for Cajero, required for elevated roles

### 7. **IP Whitelist for Admin Panel**
**Recommendation**:
- Add IP whitelist middleware for admin routes
- Configure allowed IPs per branch
- Log unauthorized access attempts

### 8. **Audit Trail Improvements**
**Current State**: Activity log tracks basic changes
**Recommendation**:
-  Add "before/after" value tracking for critical fields:
  - Loan amount changes
  - Payment amount changes
  - Item status changes
- Add "reason for change" field for sensitive operations
- Implement read-only audit report for compliance

### 9. **Session Security**
**Current State**: Sessions tracked but no automatic timeout
**Recommendation**:
- Set session timeout: 30 minutes for Cajero, 60 for Admin
- Add "auto-logout on inactivity" warning
