## Testing Notifications

To test email sending without setting up a full SMTP server, use:

### Option 1: Mailtrap (Development)

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

### Option 2: Log Driver (Just logs to file)

```env
MAIL_MAILER=log
```

Emails will be written to `storage/logs/laravel.log`

##  Customizing Notifications

Edit notification content in:
- `app/Notifications/LoanReminderNotification.php`
- `app/Notifications/LoanOverdueNotification.php`
- `app/Notifications/PaymentReceivedNotification.php`

Each notification has methods:
- `toMail()` - Email content
- `toSms()` - SMS text (140 chars max recommended)
- `toWhatsApp()` - WhatsApp message (Markdown supported)
- `toArray()` - Database notification data
