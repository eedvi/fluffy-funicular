### 4. **Configuración** (Configuration)
- BranchResource 

**Cajero Access**:  SHOULD HIDE

---

### 5. **Administración** (Administration)

**Cajero Access**:  CORRECT (Hidden)

## Summary

###  Working Correctly:
1. **ActivityResource** - Hidden from Cajero (custom `canViewAny()`)
2. **SessionResource** - Hidden from Cajero (custom `canViewAny()`)
3. **UserResource** - Hidden from Cajero (no permissions)
4. **LoanResource** - Visible, correct permissions
5. **PaymentResource** - Visible, correct permissions
6. **SaleResource** - Visible, correct permissions
7. **CustomerResource** - Visible (view-only), correct
8. **ItemResource** - Visible (view-only), correct

###  Needs Decision:
1. **BranchResource** - Currently visible to Cajero (view-only)
   - **Option A**: Remove `view_branch` + `view_any_branch` from Cajero permissions
   - **Option B**: Keep as-is (Cajero can see branches but not modify)
   - **Recommendation**: Option B is fine - cashiers need to see which branch they're in

## Recommendation: **ALL RESOURCES ARE CORRECTLY CONFIGURED** 

The system properly restricts Cajero access through Filament Shield permissions. The only resources visible are those with explicit permissions granted in RoleSeeder.
