# Loan Renewal Feature Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Branch:** feature/testing-implementation
**Status:** Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive loan renewal functionality allowing customers to extend their loan terms by paying interest for the extension period. This is a critical feature for pawn shop operations, providing customers with flexibility and generating recurring revenue.

---

## Business Logic

### What is a Loan Renewal?

When a loan reaches its due date, customers can renew it by:
1. Paying interest for an additional period (extension days)
2. Optionally paying a renewal fee
3. Extending the loan's due date

**Key Points:**
- Original loan amount remains unchanged
- Customer must pay interest for the extension period
- Optional renewal fee can be charged
- Loan status changes from 'overdue' back to 'active' if applicable
- Multiple renewals are allowed for the same loan

### Interest Calculation Formula

```
Daily Interest Rate = (Loan Amount × Interest Rate %) / Original Term Days
Interest Amount = Daily Interest Rate × Extension Days
```

**Example:**
- Loan Amount: $500
- Interest Rate: 10%
- Original Term: 30 days
- Extension: 30 days

```
Daily Rate = ($500 × 10%) / 30 = $1.67 per day
Interest = $1.67 × 30 = $50.00
```

| id | bigint | Primary key |
| loan_id | bigint | Foreign key to loans table |
| previous_due_date | date | Original due date before renewal |
| new_due_date | date | New due date after renewal |
| extension_days | integer | Number of days extended |
| renewal_fee | decimal(10,2) | Optional renewal commission |

- interest_rate → decimal:2
- interest_amount → decimal:2

**Loan Model Updates:**
- Added `hasMany(LoanRenewal::class)` relationship

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Interest calculation seems wrong
**Solution:** Verify loan's original term_days is correct. Formula uses original term, not extension days.

**Issue:** Can't find loan in dropdown
**Solution:** Only active and overdue loans appear. Check loan status.

**Issue:** Due date not updating
**Solution:** Check afterCreate() hook in CreateLoanRenewal page. Verify loan_id exists.

**Issue:** Multiple renewals causing confusion
**Solution:** Review renewal history. Each renewal should chain from previous new_due_date.
